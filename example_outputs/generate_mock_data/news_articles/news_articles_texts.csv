For those looking to add a splash of color, Tina recommends incorporating a variety of flowering plants. ""Choose a mix of early and late bloomers to ensure continuous blooms throughout the season. This not only enhances the beauty of your garden but also attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies,"" she says.

Tina's final piece of advice is to embrace the process. ""Gardening is as much about the journey as it is about the destination,"" she reflects. ""Take the time to enjoy each stage of your garden's growth, and don't be afraid to experiment and learn from any challenges you encounter.""
