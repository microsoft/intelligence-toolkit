# Deploying the App Using Azure Marketplace
This guide will help you deploy your application using Azure Marketplace, even if you're not a technical expert.

### Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following:

1. **Azure Subscription**: An active Azure subscription.
1. **OpenAI or Azure OpenAI instance**: This will provide the AI capabilities required by the application. If you don't have one, you can find [instructions here](../../OPENAI.md)
2. **Azure Account**: At minimum `Contributor` role assignment to deploy the resources in your Azure subscription.

### Steps to Deploy the App

It is recommended that you use Entra ID for authentication.

#### Creating an app registration for website authentication

- Open your web browser and go to [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade)
- On the left panel click on `Applications` then `App registrations`
- Click on `+ New registration`.
    - **Give it an identifiable name**
    - **Supported account types**:
        - Accounts in this organizational directory only (Microsoft only - Single tenant) 
- **Redirect URI**:
    - Select `Web` as platform and in the URL insert the following URL, being `[webAppName]` the name you'll give to the app on the next steps: 
        - `https://[webAppName].azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/aad/callback`
    - Click on `Register`
    - Copy the value of `Application (client) ID` to be used when creating the app in the next steps.

See details on pricing [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service/linux/) (We default to `Premium v3 P0v3` Plan)

1. **Go to Azure Marketplace**:

    - Click on the application from the search results to open its details page.

3. **Click "Create"**:
    - Click the "Create" button with Plan `Web App` selected to start the deployment process.

4. **Configure Deployment Settings**:
    - You will be redirected to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to set up the deployment.
    - Fill in the required information:
        - **Subscription**: Choose your Azure subscription.
        - **Resource Group**: Select an existing group or create a new one.
        - **Region**: Choose the region where you want to deploy the app (the closer to y ou, the better).
        - **Web App Name**: Enter a unique name for your web app.
            - This will create the URl you'll access:
                `webappname`.azurewebsites.net
        - **Service Principal Type**:
            - To create a new authentication app, leave as `Create New`

            - **Use Managed Identity**:

            - **Endpoint**:
                - If Azure OpenAI, insert the endpoint for it.
            - **Key**:
                - Only if Managed Identity is not checked, insert your OpenAI or Azure OpenAI key here.
        - **Tags** (Optional): Add any tags you want to use to organize your resources.

    - Review the settings you entered to make sure everything is correct.
    - Click the "Review + create" button to validate the settings.
    - Once validation is complete, click the "Create" button to start the deployment.

6. **Monitor Deployment**:
    - The deployment process will begin, and you can watch its progress in the Azure portal.
    - When the deployment is finished, you will get a notification.

7. **Access the Deployed Application**:
    - Go to the resource group where the application was deployed.
    - Find the web application resource and click on it to open its details page.
    - It takes a few minutes for the application to be ready. Wait about 5-10 and then use the provided URL (`webappname`.azurewebsites.net) to access your deployed application.
